This is a work in progress. It works pretty darn well at this point.

KNOWN PROBLEMS

* If you pick the kama skin the editor comes out a little too wide. Don't use kama until ckeditor bug #4049 is fixed for percentage widths. Now defaulting to the v2 skin
* The background color is always gray in the toolbar. This is a limitation of the v2 skin, it'd be nice to work around it
* I have not made a spellchecker available because ckeditor's spellchecker is an ad-supported product from spellcheck.net, probably not something our clients want. Look The spellchecker isn't appearing (and if it did, it would be a free-with-ads version of a commercial online spellchecking service, according to the CKEditor documentation). Maybe this will mature: http://cksource.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=15893
* Loading it all the time via view.yml is inefficient

INSTALLATION

* Add this plugin and enable it in ProjectConfiguration.class.php
* Set app_a_editor to ck
* Add - /apostropheCkEditorPlugin/js/ckeditor/ckeditor.js to your javascripts list 
in view.yml
* symfony cc

Boom! ckeditor replaces fckeditor in rich text slots. And shortly, everywhere
in Apostrophe.

You can have a ckextraconfig.js (like fckextraconfig.js) but you probably won't 
need one if all you want to do is override the toolbars, because you can do that
in app.yml. See aCkEditor.class.php for the default settings which you'll need
to convert to YAML to keep the existing toolbars if you choose to override this.
