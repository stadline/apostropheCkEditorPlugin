This plugin has matured to the point where we use it on our own client projects.

KNOWN PROBLEMS

* We fixed a bug with percentage widths and the kama skin in our own version, "aDefault," so that's the default skin you get. Not really a problem, just something to be aware of
* I have not made a spellchecker available because ckeditor's spellchecker is an ad-supported product from spellcheck.net, probably not something our clients want. Maybe this will mature: http://cksource.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=15893

INSTALLATION

* Add this plugin and enable it in ProjectConfiguration.class.php
* Set app_a_editor to ck in app.yml
* symfony plugin:publish-assets
* symfony cc

Boom! ckeditor replaces fckeditor in rich text slots. And everywhere else
in Apostrophe.

You can have a ckextraconfig.js (like fckextraconfig.js) but you probably won't 
need one if all you want to do is override the toolbars, because you can do that
in app.yml. See aCkEditor.class.php for the default settings which you'll need
to convert to YAML to keep the existing toolbars if you choose to override this.
